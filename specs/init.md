# PID 1 (init)
The init process is very important to the system, and this process specifically can not be restart. Hence it also can't get life updated.
This means a PID1 in test must do minimal tasks as follows:

- Start configured system processes
  - udev, syslogd, klogd, redis, haveged, etc... 
  - API, and separate modules
- init, must make sure all theses services are always up and running, re-spawn if needed
- networking ? (may be this should delegated to a separate module)
- shutdown, and reboot

# Available options on the market
- [`runit`](http://smarden.org/runit/) (very light and configurable)
- `systemd` (too much)
- `ignite` (written in rust, pretty immature and no active development)

> Other options ?
